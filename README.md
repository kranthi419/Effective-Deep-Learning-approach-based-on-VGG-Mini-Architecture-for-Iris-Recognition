# Effective-Deep-Learning-approach-based-on-VGG-Mini-Architecture-for-Iris-Recognition
Biometric system is a pattern recognition system that works by collecting biometric data from a user, extracting a feature set from that data, and comparing that feature set to a database template set. Through this paper, we propose a biometric recognition system based on iris recognition. Iris is the most secured and unique biometric trait among other biometric traits. In our work, we have proposed a modified Hough Transform and considered the Mini-VGG Net model without its weights, and trained the network to obtain the best features. Using the Neural Networks, we have performed the classification and obtained Accuracy, Precision, and Recall of 98%, 0.99, and 0.99 respectively. Our experiments were performed on the CASIA Version-1, which includes 756 samples of iris in 108 folders with 7 samples having dimensions 280X320 each.
